The following transformations are described for positive integers:

n → n / 2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 17, we generate the following sequence:

17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

Which starting number under 10,000,000 produces the longest chain?
